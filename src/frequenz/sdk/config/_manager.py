        """Create a new receiver for the configuration.

        This method has a lot of features and functionalities to make it easier to
        receive configurations.

        Note:
            If there is a burst of configuration updates, the receiver will only
            receive the last configuration, older configurations will be ignored.

        ### Skipping superfluous updates

        If `skip_unchanged` is set to `True`, then a configuration that didn't change
        compared to the last one received will be ignored and not sent to the receiver.
        The comparison is done using the *raw* `dict` to determine if the configuration
        has changed.

        ### Filtering

        The configuration can be filtered by a `key`.

        If the `key` is `None`, the receiver will receive the full configuration,
        otherwise only the part of the configuration under the specified key is
        received, or `None` if the key is not found.

        If the key is a sequence of strings, it will be treated as a nested key and the
        receiver will receive the configuration under the nested key. For example
        `["key", "subkey"]` will get only `config["key"]["subkey"]`.

        ### Schema validation

        The configuration is received as a dictionary unless a `schema` is provided. In
        this case, the configuration will be validated against the schema and received
        as an instance of the configuration class.

        The configuration `schema` class is expected to be
        a [`dataclasses.dataclass`][], which is used to create
        a [`marshmallow.Schema`][] schema to validate the configuration dictionary.

        To customize the schema derived from the configuration dataclass, you can
        use [`marshmallow_dataclass.dataclass`][] to specify extra metadata.

        Configurations that don't pass the validation will be ignored and not sent to
        the receiver, but an error will be logged. Errors other than `ValidationError`
        will not be handled and will be raised.

        Additional arguments can be passed to [`marshmallow.Schema.load`][] using keyword
        arguments.

        ### Waiting for the first configuration

        If `wait_for_first` is `True`, the receiver will wait for the first
        configuration to be received before returning the receiver. If the
        configuration can't be received in time, a timeout error will be raised.

        If the configuration is received successfully, the first configuration can be
        simply retrieved by calling [`consume()`][frequenz.channels.Receiver.consume] on
        the receiver without blocking.

        Example:
            ```python
            # TODO: Add Example
            ```

        Args:
            wait_for_first: Whether to wait for the first configuration to be received
                before returning the receiver. If the configuration can't be received
                for
                [`wait_for_first_timeout`][frequenz.sdk.config.ConfigManager.wait_for_first_timeout]
                time, a timeout error will be raised. If receiving was successful, the
                first configuration can be simply retrieved by calling
                [`consume()`][frequenz.channels.Receiver.consume] on the receiver.
            skip_unchanged: Whether to skip sending the configuration if it hasn't
                changed compared to the last one received.
            key: The key to filter the configuration. If `None`, the full configuration
                will be received.
            schema: The type of the configuration. If provided, the configuration
                will be validated against this type.
            base_schema: An optional class to be used as a base schema for the
                configuration class. This allow using custom fields for example. Will be
                passed to [`marshmallow_dataclass.class_schema`][].
            **marshmallow_load_kwargs: Additional arguments to be passed to
                [`marshmallow.Schema.load`][].

        Returns:
            The receiver for the configuration.

        Raises:
            asyncio.TimeoutError: If `wait_for_first` is `True` and the first
                configuration can't be received in time.
