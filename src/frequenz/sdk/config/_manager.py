        This method has a lot of features and functionalities to make it easier to
        receive configurations, but it also imposes some restrictions on how the
        configurations are received. If you need more control over the configuration
        receiver, you can create a receiver directly using
        [`config_channel.new_receiver()`][frequenz.sdk.config.ConfigManager.config_channel].

        ### Filtering

        Only the configuration under the `key` will be received by the receiver. If the
        `key` is not found in the configuration, the receiver will receive `None`.

        The value under `key` must be another mapping, otherwise an error
        will be logged and a [`frequenz.sdk.config.InvalidValueForKeyError`][] instance
        will be sent to the receiver.

        ### Skipping superfluous updates

        If there is a burst of configuration updates, the receiver will only receive the
        last configuration, older configurations will be ignored.

        If `skip_unchanged` is set to `True`, then a configuration that didn't change
        compared to the last one received will be ignored and not sent to the receiver.
        The comparison is done using the *raw* `dict` to determine if the configuration
        has changed.

        Example:
            ```python
            # TODO: Add Example
            ```

        Args:
            key: The configuration key to be read by the receiver.
            skip_unchanged: Whether to skip sending the configuration if it hasn't
                changed compared to the last one received.

            The receiver for the configuration.
