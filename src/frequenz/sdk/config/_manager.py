        """Create a new receiver for receiving the configuration for a particular key.

        This method has a lot of features and functionalities to make it easier to
        receive configurations, but it also imposes some restrictions on how the
        configurations are received. If you need more control over the configuration
        receiver, you can create a receiver directly using
        [`config_channel.new_receiver()`][frequenz.sdk.config.ConfigManager.config_channel].

        ### Filtering

        Only the configuration under the `key` will be received by the receiver. If the
        `key` is not found in the configuration, the receiver will receive `None`.

        If the key is a sequence of strings, it will be treated as a nested key and the
        receiver will receive the configuration under the nested key. For example
        `["key", "subkey"]` will get only `config["key"]["subkey"]`.

        The value under `key` must be another mapping, otherwise an error
        will be logged and a [`frequenz.sdk.config.InvalidValueForKeyError`][] instance
        will be sent to the receiver.

        ### Schema validation

        The raw configuration received as a `Mapping` will be validated and loaded to
        as a `config_class`. The `config_class` class is expected to be
        a [`dataclasses.dataclass`][], which is used to create
        a [`marshmallow.Schema`][] via the [`marshmallow_dataclass.class_schema`][]
        function.

        This means you can customize the schema derived from the configuration
        dataclass using [`marshmallow_dataclass`][] to specify extra validation and
        options via field metadata.

        Additional arguments can be passed to [`marshmallow.Schema.load`][] using
        the `marshmallow_load_kwargs` keyword arguments.

        ### Skipping superfluous updates

        If there is a burst of configuration updates, the receiver will only receive the
        last configuration, older configurations will be ignored.

        If `skip_unchanged` is set to `True`, then a configuration that didn't change
        compared to the last one received will be ignored and not sent to the receiver.
        The comparison is done using the *raw* `dict` to determine if the configuration
        has changed.

        ### Error handling

        The value under `key` must be another mapping, otherwise an error
        will be logged and a [`frequenz.sdk.config.InvalidValueForKeyError`][] instance
        will be sent to the receiver.

        Configurations that don't pass the validation will be logged as an error and
        the [`ValidationError`][marshmallow.ValidationError] sent to the receiver.

        Any other unexpected error raised during the configuration loading will be
        logged as an error and the error instance sent to the receiver.

        Example:
            ```python
            # TODO: Add Example
            ```

        Args:
            key: The configuration key to be read by the receiver. If a sequence of
                strings is used, it is used as a sub-key.
            config_class: The class object to use to instantiate a configuration. The
                configuration will be validated against this type too using
                [`marshmallow_dataclass`][].
            skip_unchanged: Whether to skip sending the configuration if it hasn't
                changed compared to the last one received.
            base_schema: An optional class to be used as a base schema for the
                configuration class. This allow using custom fields for example. Will be
                passed to [`marshmallow_dataclass.class_schema`][].
            marshmallow_load_kwargs: Additional arguments to be passed to
                [`marshmallow.Schema.load`][].

        Returns:
            The receiver for the configuration.
