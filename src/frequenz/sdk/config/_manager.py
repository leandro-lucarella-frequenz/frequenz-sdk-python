        """Create a new receiver for the configuration.

        This method has a lot of features and functionalities to make it easier to
        receive configurations.

        Note:
            If there is a burst of configuration updates, the receiver will only
            receive the last configuration, older configurations will be ignored.

        ### Skipping superfluous updates

        If `skip_unchanged` is set to `True`, then a configuration that didn't change
        compared to the last one received will be ignored and not sent to the receiver.
        The comparison is done using the *raw* `dict` to determine if the configuration
        has changed.

        ### Filtering

        The configuration can be filtered by a `key`.

        If the `key` is `None`, the receiver will receive the full configuration,
        otherwise only the part of the configuration under the specified key is
        received, or `None` if the key is not found.

        ### Waiting for the first configuration

        If `wait_for_first` is `True`, the receiver will wait for the first
        configuration to be received before returning the receiver. If the
        configuration can't be received in time, a timeout error will be raised.

        If the configuration is received successfully, the first configuration can be
        simply retrieved by calling [`consume()`][frequenz.channels.Receiver.consume] on
        the receiver without blocking.

        Example:
            ```python
            # TODO: Add Example
            ```

        Args:
            wait_for_first: Whether to wait for the first configuration to be received
                before returning the receiver. If the configuration can't be received
                for
                [`wait_for_first_timeout`][frequenz.sdk.config.ConfigManager.wait_for_first_timeout]
                time, a timeout error will be raised. If receiving was successful, the
                first configuration can be simply retrieved by calling
                [`consume()`][frequenz.channels.Receiver.consume] on the receiver.
            skip_unchanged: Whether to skip sending the configuration if it hasn't
                changed compared to the last one received.
            key: The key to filter the configuration. If `None`, the full configuration
                will be received.

        Returns:
            The receiver for the configuration.

        Raises:
            asyncio.TimeoutError: If `wait_for_first` is `True` and the first
                configuration can't be received in time.
