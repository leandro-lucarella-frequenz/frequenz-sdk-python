        """Create a new receiver for the configuration.

        This method has a lot of features and functionalities to make it easier to
        receive configurations.

        Note:
            If there is a burst of configuration updates, the receiver will only
            receive the last configuration, older configurations will be ignored.

        ### Schema validation

        The raw configuration received as a `Mapping` will be validated and loaded to
        as a `config_class`. The `config_class` class is expected to be
        a [`dataclasses.dataclass`][], which is used to create
        a [`marshmallow.Schema`][] via the [`marshmallow_dataclass.class_schema`][]
        function.

        This means you can customize the schema derived from the configuration
        dataclass using [`marshmallow_dataclass`][] to specify extra validation and
        options via field metadata.

        Configurations that don't pass the validation will be ignored and not sent to
        the receiver, but an error will be logged. Errors other than `ValidationError`
        will not be handled and will be raised.

        Additional arguments can be passed to [`marshmallow.Schema.load`][] using
        the `marshmallow_load_kwargs` keyword arguments.

        ### Skipping superfluous updates

        If `skip_unchanged` is set to `True`, then a configuration that didn't change
        compared to the last one received will be ignored and not sent to the receiver.
        The comparison is done using the *raw* `dict` to determine if the configuration
        has changed.

        If `skip_none` is set to `True`, then a configuration that is `None` will be
        ignored and not sent to the receiver. This is useful for cases where the the
        receiver can't react to `None` configurations, either because it is handled
        externally or because it should just keep the previous configuration.
        This can only be used when `key` is not `None` as when `key` is `None`, the
        configuration can never be `None`.

        ### Filtering

        The configuration can be filtered by a `key`.

        If the `key` is `None`, the receiver will receive the full configuration,
        otherwise only the part of the configuration under the specified key is
        received, or `None` if the key is not found.

        If the key is a sequence of strings, it will be treated as a nested key and the
        receiver will receive the configuration under the nested key. For example
        `["key", "subkey"]` will get only `config["key"]["subkey"]`.

        Example:
            ```python
            # TODO: Add Example
            ```

        Args:
            config_class: The type of the configuration. If provided, the configuration
                will be validated against this type.
            skip_unchanged: Whether to skip sending the configuration if it hasn't
                changed compared to the last one received.
            skip_none: Whether to skip sending the configuration if it is `None`. Only
                valid when `key` is not `None`.
            key: The key to filter the configuration. If `None`, the full configuration
                will be received.
            base_schema: An optional class to be used as a base schema for the
                configuration class. This allow using custom fields for example. Will be
                passed to [`marshmallow_dataclass.class_schema`][].
            **marshmallow_load_kwargs: Additional arguments to be passed to
                [`marshmallow.Schema.load`][].

        Returns:
            The receiver for the configuration.
